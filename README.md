A Tetris Game.

I tried to make this game for practicing, 
so don't complain to me just because of something shortages in it.

Of course,
Just tell me if you find any problem or have any suggest, I will improve this game as quick as possible.

By the way, this game have no the highest score recording board and some sound effects.

I will add it if I get free time.

Download Tetris.rar and open Tetris.exe. 

Enjoy the game:)
